# Media center
# Tested on: Debian 8.6 Jessie
# Updated & tested: 12/10/2016

# This builds a media center using Kodi, tvheadend & LTSP. At the end you should have the following
# - Main server with Kodi and lots of software for work, rest and play
# - Fat clients booting from the main server with Kodi & some software for basic browsing/email.
#
# Run
# ansible-playbook media_center.yml -b -v
# -b become sudo
# -v verbose
